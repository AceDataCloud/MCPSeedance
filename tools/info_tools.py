Video Generation:
- seedance_generate_video: Create video from a text prompt (T2V)
- seedance_generate_video_from_image: Create video using reference images (I2V)

Task Management:
- seedance_get_task: Check status of a single generation
- seedance_get_tasks_batch: Check status of multiple generations

Information:
- seedance_list_models: Show available models and pricing
- seedance_list_resolutions: Show available resolutions and ratios
- seedance_list_actions: Show this action reference (you are here)

Workflow Examples:

1. Quick text-to-video:
   seedance_generate_video -> seedance_get_task

2. Image-to-video (animate an image):
   seedance_generate_video_from_image (with first_frame_url) -> seedance_get_task

3. Video transition between two images:
   seedance_generate_video_from_image (with first_frame_url + last_frame_url)

4. Style-guided generation:
   seedance_generate_video_from_image (with reference_image_urls)

5. Async generation (for production):
   seedance_generate_video (with callback_url) -> webhook notification

6. Budget-friendly generation:
   seedance_generate_video (with model=fast, service_tier='flex')

7. High-quality with audio:
   seedance_generate_video (with model=1.5-pro, generate_audio=true)

Tips:
- Use descriptive prompts for better results
- Include motion descriptions: "walking", "flying", "zooming in"
- Specify style: "cinematic", "realistic", "artistic", "anime"
- 1.5 Pro model supports audio generation (~2x cost)
- Use 'flex' service tier for 50% cost savings (slower processing)
- Use seed parameter for reproducible results
- Use return_last_frame=true when planning to extend videos
